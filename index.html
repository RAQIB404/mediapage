        <h4> <u> DESCRIPTION - Rarest Fish on Earth: Devils Hole Pupfish </u> </h4> 
       <p>A rocky outcropping in the middle of the hottest place on Earth and the driest stretch of land in North America is hardly the place you’d expect to find fish. But a group of tiny, shimmery fish frolic seemingly without a care in the famous Devils Hole in the Death Valley desert.

        The narrow cavern is filled with shockingly clear water that’s regularly 93 degrees Fahrenheit with dangerously low oxygen levels. Indeed, the bottomless geothermal pool that gives the Devils Hole pupfish (Cyprinodon diabolis) their name — plus some frisky mating behavior that resembles puppies playing — is the narrowest geographic range of any vertebrate. And with only 175 total fish at last count, they’re the rarest fish on the planet.
        
        But Earth has warmed 1.9 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900, and desert ecosystems that cover about 25 percent of the Earth’s surface are especially at risk, along with the desert fish.
        
        Climate change will shift seasonal patterns and rising temperatures will increase physiological stress on desert plants and animals. Now, scientists are racing to study how these unique fish have survived in nearly uninhabitable environments to save them.</p>

    <h4> <u>Brief description of the rarest Fish on Earth: Devils Hole Pupfish</u> </h4> 
    <p>The Devils Hole pupfish is considered the “canary in the coal mine” for broader environmental changes. Scientists have counted the population since the 1950s, typically finding about 200 during springtime and 450 in fall until the 1990s, when numbers began to drop.

        “It hit rock bottom in 2007, when we were at 38 individuals, and 2013, when we were at 35,” says Chris Martin, a fish ecologist and professor at University of California Berkeley. “But they're on the rebound. Most recently, it was up to 175, the highest it's been in 22 years.”</p>
